# AI-Driven Water Demand Forecasting System for Urban Areas

A comprehensive machine learning project that predicts urban water consumption using Linear Regression and ARIMA time-series models.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project addresses the critical challenge of water resource management in urban areas by implementing AI-powered forecasting models. The system predicts future water demand based on historical data, population trends, and environmental factors, enabling authorities to optimize water supply and reduce wastage.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Dual Model Approach**: Implements both Linear Regression and ARIMA models
- **Realistic Data Simulation**: Generates synthetic urban water consumption data
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Uses MAE, RMSE, and R² metrics
- **Rich Visualizations**: Creates detailed graphs and analysis charts
- **Academic Documentation**: Includes detailed report suitable for project submissions

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**

2. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Project

**Execute the main script:**
```bash
python water_demand_forecasting.py
```

This will:
- Generate a synthetic water consumption dataset
- Preprocess the data
- Train Linear Regression and ARIMA models
- Evaluate model performance
- Generate visualizations
- Save results to CSV and image files

## 📊 What the System Does

### 1. Data Generation
Creates a realistic dataset with:
- Monthly water consumption (60 months)
- Population data (gradually increasing)
- Temperature (seasonal patterns)
- Rainfall (seasonal patterns)
- Seasonal classifications

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handles missing values
- Normalizes numerical features
- Encodes categorical variables
- Splits data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets

### 3. Model Training

**Linear Regression:**
- Predicts water demand based on population, temperature, rainfall, and season
- Captures relationships between multiple features

**ARIMA (2,1,2):**
- Time-series model using historical consumption patterns
- Captures temporal dependencies and trends

### 4. Evaluation
Calculates:
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)
- **R² Score** (Coefficient of Determination)

### 5. Visualizations
Generates:
- Actual vs Predicted scatter plots
- Time series comparison charts
- Seasonal consumption trends
- Feature correlation heatmap

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import Error:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels
```

**ARIMA Warning:**
- Warnings about convergence are normal and can be ignored
- The model will still produce valid results

**Visualization Issues:**
- Ensure matplotlib backend is properly configured
- On some systems, you may need: `export MPLBACKEND=TkAgg`
